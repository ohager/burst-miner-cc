Visual Control Center for Burstcoin Mining

> # HANG TIGHT
> There will be stuff soon

This will be a browser-based dashboard for Burstcoin mining. 
The idea is to provide all interesting data for the miner in 
a comprehensive and beautiful manner.

Some of the planned features are:

- Keep historical mining data, like commited/accepted Deadlines, Network difficulties etc
- Show various (real-time) information about burst revenue
- Realtime BURST -> FIAT conversions, and other important trading information
- Logging, especially anomalities like network failures,
- Miner Watchdog, with automatic mining process restart in case of freezes/failures 
- Event Notifications (Push, Mail), for e.g. won blocks, or other interesting stuff

### So, be excited what's coming up!
